# Multiplayer Setup - SpinLegends

## üéÆ Description
This project includes complete multiplayer functionality using Photon PUN 2. Players can connect and fight in real-time spinning top battles with dynamic health bars, elegant UI, and smooth network synchronization.

## üìã Prerequisites
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or higher
- Photon PUN 2 (already included in the project)
- Free Photon account (https://www.photonengine.com/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup

### 1. Configure Photon App ID
1. Go to [Photon Dashboard](https://dashboard.photonengine.com/)
2. Create a new application or use an existing one
3. Copy your **App ID**
4. In Unity, go to `Window > Photon Unity Networking > PUN Wizard`
5. Paste your App ID in the corresponding field
6. Click "Setup Project"

### 2. Automatic Setup (Recommended)
The project now includes automatic setup scripts:
1. Run the game
2. The `AutoSetup` script will automatically configure:
   - NetworkManager
   - PlayerSpawnManager
   - MultiplayerUI with transparent panels
   - HealthBarManager
   - AndroidSettings
   - JoystickFixer for mobile compatibility

### 3. Manual Configuration (Alternative)
If you prefer manual setup:
1. Select the `playerspin` prefab in `Assets/Prefabs/`
2. Add the `PhotonView` component if it doesn't have it
3. In the PhotonView, assign `PlayerController` and `NetworkPlayerCollision` as Observed Components
4. Make sure the prefab is in the `Resources/` folder

## üéØ Added Components

### NetworkManager
- Handles Photon connection
- Manages rooms and players
- Automatic player spawning
- Room creation and joining

### PlayerController (Enhanced)
- Position and rotation synchronization
- Spin state synchronization with smooth interpolation
- Health synchronization
- Joystick input handling for mobile
- Network interpolation for smooth movement

### HealthBarManager
- Creates health bars for all players automatically
- Health bars follow each player in the arena
- Color-coded health display (green/yellow/red)
- Animated effects for damage and healing

### MultiplayerUI (Improved)
- Transparent status panel (top-right)

## üè• Health Bar System

### Features
- **Dynamic Health Bars**: Each player has a health bar that follows their spinner
- **Color Coding**: 
  - üü¢ Green: High health (70%+)
  - üü° Yellow: Medium health (30-69%)
  - üî¥ Red: Low health (below 30%)
- **Visual Effects**: Flash effects on damage, glow effects on healing, pulse on critical health
- **Smooth Animation**: Health bars smoothly follow players and face the camera

### Configuration
```csharp
// In HealthBarManager
public Vector3 healthBarOffset = new Vector3(0, 3f, 0);
public bool showHealthBarsForAllPlayers = true;
public bool showHealthBarForLocalPlayer = true;
```

## üñ•Ô∏è UI Improvements

### Transparent Panels
- **Status Panel**: 30% opacity black background
- **Room Info Panel**: 30% opacity black background
- **Non-intrusive Design**: Panels don't block gameplay view

### English Interface
- All UI text in English
- Connection status messages
- Room information
- Debug messages

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Developers
1. Configure your Photon App ID
2. Run the game
3. AutoSetup will configure everything automatically
4. NetworkManager will connect automatically
5. Players will join rooms automatically

### For Players
1. Run the game
2. Game will connect automatically to Photon
3. Will join an existing room or create a new one
4. Health bars will appear for all players
5. Start fighting!

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Customize Health Bar Appearance
```csharp
// In HealthBar.cs
public Color highHealthColor = Color.green;
public Color mediumHealthColor = Color.yellow;
public Color lowHealthColor = Color.red;
public float highHealthThreshold = 0.7f;
public float mediumHealthThreshold = 0.3f;
```

### Adjust Panel Transparency
```csharp
// In SceneSetup.cs
statusPanelImage.color = new Color(0, 0, 0, 0.3f); // 30% opacity
roomInfoPanelImage.color = new Color(0, 0, 0, 0.3f); // 30% opacity
```

### Customize Spawn Points
```csharp
// In NetworkManager, modify the spawnPoints array
public Transform[] spawnPoints;
```

### Adjust Network Synchronization
```csharp
// In PlayerController, modify interpolation speeds
public float interpolationSpeed = 15f;
public float rotationInterpolationSpeed = 15f;
public float velocityInterpolationSpeed = 15f;
public float spinInterpolationSpeed = 10f;
```

### Configure Collision System
```csharp
// In NetworkPlayerCollision
public float knockbackForce = 25f;
public float minCollisionForce = 1f;
public float collisionDamageMultiplier = 1f;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "App ID not configured"
- Verify you've configured the App ID in PUN Wizard
- Make sure the App ID is correct

### Error: "Player prefab not found"
- AutoSetup should handle this automatically
- Verify the prefab is in the Resources folder

### Players not visible
- Verify PhotonView is configured correctly
- Make sure PlayerController and NetworkPlayerCollision are marked as Observed

### Health bars not appearing
- Check that HealthBarManager is present in the scene
- Verify AutoSetup ran successfully

### Lag or jerky movement
- Adjust interpolation speeds in PlayerController
- Check your internet connection
- Consider using closer Photon regions

### Joystick not working on mobile
- AutoSetup includes JoystickFixer for mobile compatibility
- Check that EventSystem and Canvas are properly configured
