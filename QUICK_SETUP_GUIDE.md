2. In the Inspector, click **"Add Component"**
3. Search and add **"Photon View"**
4. In the PhotonView, click **"Observed Components"**
5. Add the **PlayerController** as observed component
6. Save the prefab

### **2. Configure the Scene (2 minutes)**
1. Open the `SpinLegends` scene
2. Create an empty GameObject called **"AutoSetup"**
3. Add the **"AutoSetup"** component
4. The setup will run automatically on Start

6. Click **"Verify Setup"** to check everything is working

### **3. Test Multiplayer (1 minute)**
1. Press **Play** in Unity
2. Go to **File > Build Settings**
3. Click **"Build And Run"**
4. Both instances will connect automatically!

## 🎯 **Quick Verification:**

### ✅ **If you see these messages in the console:**

```

### ❌ **If you see errors:**
- **"PhotonView not found"**: Follow step 1
- **"No spawn points"**: Create empty objects named "SpawnPoint1", "SpawnPoint2", etc.
- **"Player prefab not assigned"**: Use "Find Player Prefab" in SceneSetup

## 🎮 **How to Play:**

1. **Movement**: Use joystick or WASD
2. **Spin**: Press the spin button
3. **Jump**: Press Space or jump button
4. **Collisions**: Beyblades take damage when they collide

## 🔧 **Advanced Configuration (Optional):**

### **Add Spawn Points Manually:**
1. Create empty GameObjects in the arena
2. Name them "SpawnPoint1", "SpawnPoint2", etc.
3. Position them in different areas of the arena

### **Customize Colors:**
1. Select the `playerspin` prefab
2. Change the renderer material
3. Each player will have a different color

### **Adjust Sync Speed:**
1. In `PlayerController.cs`, find this line:
```csharp
transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, networkPosition, Time.deltaTime * 10f);
```
2. Change the number `10f` to adjust smoothness

## 🐛 **Common Problem Solutions:**

### **Players not visible:**
- Verify PhotonView is configured
- Make sure PlayerController is in "Observed Components"

### **Jumpy movement:**
- Adjust interpolation in PlayerController
- Check your internet connection

### **Won't connect:**
- Verify App ID is correct
- Make sure you have internet connection

## 🎉 **Ready!**

Once you complete these steps, your Beyblade game will have complete multiplayer. Players will be able to:
- Connect automatically
- See other players in real-time
- Fight in multiplayer battles
- Collide and damage each other
